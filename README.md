# Chess_Tutor
A javascript based Chess Tutor demo made as a fun side project.
Please note it's not the actual game but only showcases where a chessman could plausibly move on the chess board. The purpose of the tutor is to only show / highlight the possbile moves for every type of chessman / piece on the board once selected.
