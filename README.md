# Chess_Tutor
A javascript based Chess Tutor demo made as a fun side project.
Please note it's not the actual game but only showcases where a chessman could plausibly move on the chess board. The purpose of the tutor is to only show / highlight the possbile moves for every type of chessman / piece on the board once selected.

Run index1.html to launch the tutor. 

Instructions to play :
1. Select a chess piece / chessman and place it on the highlighted box.
